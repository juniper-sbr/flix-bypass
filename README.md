# flix bypass; my version
A simplified version of the extension made by *Amachik* because I couldn't make theirs work so I just rewrote it :D https://github.com/Amachik/HouseholdNoMore

MAIN BRANCH ONLY WORKS IN THE FOLLOWING
- Google Chrome
- Microsoft Edge
- Netflix desktop app (IF downloaded from Microsoft store)

# Install for browser
- Press the green *Code* button at the top of the page and select *Download ZIP*
- Extract the files wherever you prefer
- Navigate to *Extensions* in your browser (top right corner) and select *Manage Extensions*
- Toggle on *Developer mode*
- Click *Load Unpacked* and select the extracted folder
- Toggle extension *on*
# ⚠️DO NOT DISABLE *DEVELOPER TOOLS* IF YOU ARE USING CHROME 
As this extension is downloaded from an external source, disabling dev tools disables the program!
You can disable dev tools if you are on edge!

# Install for desktop app
All apps downloaded through Microsoft store are stored in Edge's files, this means if you follow the above instructions in your *Microsoft Edge* browser, the effect will work on the desktop app
